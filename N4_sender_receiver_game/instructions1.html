    <p>
        Today, you will be randomly paired with another participant to play a game.
        The computer has randomly assigned you the role of <b>Player A or Player B,</b> which you will keep for
        the <b>{{ Constants.num_rounds }} rounds of the game.</b>
        We will tell you your role after we have explained the game. In each round, if you are a Player A,
        you will be randomly matched with a Player B, and vice versa. <b>Your partner will change randomly from
        one round to the next.</b> Neither of you will know the identity of the other, and all interactions will
        be anonymized by the computers.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is a game where Player A sends a message to Player B, who then guesses a secret number. The payoffs for both players depend on Player B's guess and the secret number.

        <i class="fas fa-gamepad"></i>   How the Game Works
    </h3>

 <p>
    Each round of the game has <b>four steps.</b>
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
       <i class="fas fa-dice"></i>  The computer generates a <b>secret number</b>, which is <b>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.</b>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        <i class="fa fa-envelope" aria-hidden="true"></i> Player A sends <b>a message</b> to Player B saying <b>"To receive the highest payoff, you should guess X."</b>
        <b>Player A can choose any number</b> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 for X. You will learn more about Player A's exact choice options below.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        <i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i> Player B <b>observes</b> the <b>message</b> and <b>guesses the secret number.</b>
        Player B can <b>guess any number</b> between 1 and 7, including two-digit numbers.
        For example, a Player B who thinks that 1 and 2 are equally likely can guess 1.50, and a Player B
        who thinks that the secret number is either 4 or 5 but most likely 5 can make a guess between
        4 and 5 but closer to 5, such as 4.8. {{ if player.participant.treatment == "Decode" }}Sometimes, Player B will have to <b>decode</b> the message before making a guess. You will learn more about this later.{{ endif }}
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
       <i class="fas fa-chart-bar"></i>  Both Player A and Player B will receive <b>feedback.</b>
        This feedback will include the secret number generated by the computer, Player A's message, and Player B's guess.
    </li>
</ol>

    <b> How does the computer generate the secret number?</b> <br>
    You can think of the computer as a device that randomly selects one of
    seven balls from an urn that are numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
</p>

 <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
    <img src="{% static 'global/urn.png' %}" alt="Urn Image" class="img-fluid" width="50%">
 </div>
<br>


<p>
    As the urn contains one ball of each number, the <b>probability of generating any given
    number between 1 and 7 is equal.</b> Consequently,
    <b>you can reasonably assume</b> that the secret number will, <b>on average, be equal to 4.</b>
</p>
<p>
    These draws are <b>completely independent</b> across rounds. This means that you should <b>not strategize</b>
    about the value of the secret number based on the value of secret number in a previous round.
</p>
</p>

<div id="paragraph4" class="hidden-paragraph">
    <p>
    <b>Does Player A know the secret number when sending the message?</b><br> No, Player A does <b>not know</b> the secret number when sending the message.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>What can Player A choose to send?</b><br> Player A can choose any number between 1 and 7 to send as a message to Player B. For example, if Player A chooses “2”,
    Player B will receive the message "To receive the highest payoff, you should guess 2." {{ if player.participant.treatment != "Babbling" }}</p><p>Instead of sending a specific number, Player A can also <b>delegate</b> the decision to the computer who transmits the <b>true secret number</b> to Player B. If Player A chooses this option, Player B will receive the message "To receive the highest payoff, you should guess X", where the computer will replace X with the true secret number it generated at the start of the round. Since the message format stays the same, Player B will <b>never know</b> whether Player A <b>chose to delegate</b> the decision to the computer <b>or not.</b> {{ endif }}
