            Time Limits
        </h3>

    <p>
        In each round, Player A will have <b>{{Constants.TIME_PER_ROUND }} seconds time</b> to
        choose a message. Player B will then have {{Constants.TIME_PER_ROUND }} seconds
        time to make a guess. After Player B makes a guess, both players will observe feedback for 5 seconds.
        Then, a new round starts.
    </p>

    <p>
        Make sure that you stay within the {{Constants.TIME_PER_ROUND }} seconds allotted to you. If you don't, this will have consequences for your bonus payment.
    </p>

        <input id="info_buttonA" type="button" value="&#xf178" onclick="button_click(info_buttonA, PlayerA);" />

    <div class="hidden-paragraph" id="PlayerA">
    <p>
        Here is what happens if <strong>Player A</strong> does not send a message in time:
        <ul>
            <li>Player A will receive <strong>no bonus</strong> for sure for this round.</li>
            <li>Player B will receive no message but can still make a guess.</li>
            <li>Player B gets paid according to Player B's guess.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <input id="info_buttonB" type="button" value="&#xf178" onclick="buttonAppear(); button_click(info_buttonB, PlayerB);" />
    </p>

    </div>

    <div class="hidden-paragraph" id="PlayerB">
    <p>
        Here is what happens if <strong>Player B</strong> does not make a guess in time:
        <ul>
            <li>Player B's guess will be set equal to Player A's message. For example, if Player A advised "You should guess 5" and Player B fails to respond in time, Player B's guess will be 5.</li>
            <li>Both players get paid according to Player B's guess.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        If both players fail to stay within the time limit, both players will receive no bonus for the round.
